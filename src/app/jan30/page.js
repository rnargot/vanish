I created this email over a year ago, but had to let my perfectionism wolves fight it out before I could share my writing. Either my inner critic has healed some, or my passions have grown far stronger– regardless, I am excited to reopen this wonderful channel of communication: e-mail. 

This year, I decided to harvest a new technology ecosystem for myself. I dream of living amongst a web of devices hand-selected by me, designed to serve a specific purpose in my life with simplicity and ease. Composed of gears and conductors, a circuit board weaving electricity through mechanical parts, each creature in my ecosystem waits patiently for its moment to shine in my day. What beautiful things can flourish in a modern-day, techno-diverse environment? 

I wanted to take a ground-up approach to grow my technology ecosystem– starting with a bare bed of lush, nutritious earth, what is the first plant I will grow? Do I have space for this tree, will it be symbiotic with others, or will I preserve this empty space for infinite possibilities? Just because something can grow and flourish does not mean it won’t leech from the others, or worse: obstruct the beautiful view of my dreams just beyond the horizon. 

We used to purchase devices from a place of absence– a need organically forming through an inconvenience lived through every day. As I’m lying outside with my thoughts on a summer night, the pink and orange gradient folding into the dimming sky, how can I capture this beautiful sight? We moved through life authentically, and when the opportunity arose, used technology to further our reach and enhance the self. 

Tucked away at the local Goodwill, shelves of cameras stare at me, each with its own little face and personality. I envision each one by my side– the click of the shutter, the extension of the lens, the feeling of the strap on my wrist. One by one, each device comes to life in my hands, until I find one particularly difficult to put down. Will she get along with the others at home, or will she need a special cable to communicate with them? Does she require the same nutrients, or do I need to buy special batteries for her? She will stay the same until the end of her life, perhaps a few scratches that age her, maybe she loads a bit slower, but the little creature I bought will be the same creature that dies: a pink, wide aperture camera with a daffodil sticker on the side. And when that day comes, she will be replaced by another, who will inherit her daffodil sticker, meticulously transferred by clumsy hands. Her legacy lives on. 

Our devices tell a story, and together form a visual representation of the self. The tools we carry with us, the electronics we use every day, become who we are. They are an opportunity to express ourselves: an extension of our abilities and a diversification of the collective. Our technology ecosystems are a beautiful manifestation of authenticity. 

I never chose my smartphone from a place of absence. I’ve never lived my adult life for an extended period of time without it, and decided that I prefer my life with it, that there is space for it to live. And the smartphone I bought is not the same smartphone that dies: software updates expand the data they can exploit from me, government legislature changes the apps available to me. Large corporations change the content that I see, billionaires with political agendas change the names of familiar platforms before my very eyes. Facetuned influencers tell me what clothing I need to be desired by men, convincing me of the problem and selling me the solution– the oldest marketing trick in the book. What used to be the solution to an organic need twisted into the very thing telling me what I need, and what I will be in a constant state of needing, forever: more. 

I fell for the bait and switch– the innocent tree I had planted with 4GB of storage, 128GB of RAM and a headphone jack, has somehow invaded my entire ecosystem. When did I sign up for this? How can I give consent to something that is boundlessly evolving before my very eyes? 

Does a single device, with its unimaginable intelligence and volatile agenda, really outweigh a community of techno-diverse magic? 

My journey to cultivating my technology ecosystem starts with decomposition: what utilities on my smartphone actually enhance my ability to be my authentic self? And of those, which single-purpose devices or technologies will I choose to care for and love, to move through life alongside me? The answers have already surprised me. 

It’s time to plant a seed for my social network, and I am choosing e-mail and my personal websites as my creatures for connecting authentically with others. I hope you will be open to interacting with me in this new way, exchanging your thoughts and ideas with me, and archiving our lives with beautiful, rich e-mail chains. Where I once may have shared a photo dump or story of my life, glued to a device that had my anxiety in a choke hold, I look forward to instead sending you e-mails stuffed with my passions, thoughts, and beautiful life moments. I would love to show you what can grow as I reclaim my relationship with technology.
